* <strong>APP Banners in Home-screen</strong>: Automatically notifies your visitor to get the APP version of the website which directly gets added with the list of Apps and Home-screen. You can customize the icons for this as well.
* <strong>Web App Manifest</strong>: The Manifest file is necessary to get this functionality rolled out and we have made this automatic and connected with the PWA options.
* <strong>Offline Support</strong>: The PWA version of your site will load blazing fast even when the user is offline. Once the user is online, it will update the content again. It will also count the analytics as well and updates it when the user goes online again.
