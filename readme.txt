* <strong>APP Banners in Home-screen</strong>: Automatically notifies your visitor to get the APP version of the website which directly gets added with the list of Apps and Home-screen. You can customize the icons for this as well.
* <strong>Web App Manifest</strong>: The Manifest file is necessary to get this functionality rolled out and we have made this automatic and connected with the PWA options.
